# PRODIGY_GA_01
Training a model to generate coherent and contextually relevent text based on a given prompt.Starting with GPT-2,a transformer model developed by OpenAI,the model is fine tuned on custom dataset to create text that mimics style and structure of training data.

# Text Generation with GPT-2

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use GPT-2, a powerful text generation model by OpenAI, to generate text based on a given prompt.

## Features

- Generate text using GPT-2
- Fine-tune the model on your own dataset

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Transformers library
- PyTorch or TensorFlow

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gpt2-text-generation.git
    cd gpt2-text-generation
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```
    pip install transformers torch  # or tensorflow if you prefer TensorFlow
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset as a plain text file.

2. Fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your dataset.

3. Use the fine-tuned model to generate text based on a prompt.
